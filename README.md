## Raw Arrays
What is an array and how does it work?
* Stores a sequence of elements
* Each element must be the same data type
* Occupies a contiguous block of memory
* Can access access data in constant time with this equation: memory_address = starting_address + index * data_size
`arr[3] === (&arr + 3 * 4)`
